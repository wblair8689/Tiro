TITLE: Swift + Python + Future Web Dev Monorepo with Xcode & Cursor Integration

OVERVIEW:
We are creating a monorepo structured around a Swift Package Manager (SPM) project 
for Swift code, complemented by a separate Python module and test suite, with the 
future option of adding a React or similar web front-end. The goal is to maintain 
TDD across all sub-projects, allow seamless file creation from an AI code editor 
(Cursor), and ensure that Xcode recognizes newly generated files automatically.

SWIFT PROJECT MANAGEMENT:
• Use Swift Package Manager as the canonical build system.
• Open the package in Xcode via the 'Package.swift' file.
• Rely on Xcode’s auto-generated workspace for building and running tests.
• TDD is enforced through XCTest in 'Tests/'.

PYTHON MODULE:
• Python code lives under 'python/'.
• Use 'pytest' (or similar) in 'python/tests/' for TDD.
• Separate Python dependencies via 'requirements.txt' or 'pyproject.toml'.
• (Optional) Integrate with Swift using PythonKit or external processes.

WEB/REACT (OPTIONAL LATER):
• Place React (or other framework) in 'web/'.
• Maintain its own build/test system (npm/yarn).
• Keep TDD with Jest, Cypress, or your tool of choice.

DEV WORKFLOW WITH CURSOR:
1. Open the root of the monorepo in Cursor.
2. Let Cursor auto-generate Swift files under 'Sources/' or 'Tests/' – Xcode automatically picks them up.
3. Let Cursor auto-generate Python files under 'python/' – 'pytest' automatically sees them.
4. Write/Generate tests first (TDD), then implement features.

CI/CD PIPELINE:
• Unified pipeline:
  1. swift test
  2. pip install -r python/requirements.txt && pytest python/tests/
  3. (Optional) cd web && npm install && npm test
• Ensures the code passes all tests before merging.

BENEFITS:
• No manual .xcodeproj file updates needed.
• Easy TDD for both Swift and Python code.
• Straightforward addition of a React/web project later.
• Cursor file generation integrates seamlessly with the SwiftPM folder conventions.

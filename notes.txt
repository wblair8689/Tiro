Before generating or modifying code:
1. First read and analyze all related files to understand existing types and structures
2. Check for existing type declarations in the codebase, especially in shared/common files
3. Verify all necessary imports are present and correct

When writing new code:
1. Place shared types, protocols, and extensions in dedicated files (e.g., SharedTypes.swift, Protocols.swift)
2. Explicitly declare all dependencies at the top of each file
3. Never duplicate type declarations - if a type might be used elsewhere, put it in a shared file
4. Verify protocol conformance is complete with all required methods and properties

After writing code:
1. Verify all types match and are properly imported
2. Check for duplicate declarations across all modified files
3. Ensure all protocols and overrides are fully implemented
4. Confirm file naming follows the project's conventions
5. If modifying existing types, verify all existing usages remain valid

When receiving error messages:
1. Address the root cause rather than just the symptom
2. If a type conflict occurs, always move shared types to a dedicated file
3. Document any assumptions made about existing types or structures
